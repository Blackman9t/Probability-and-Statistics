The Big Picture.  
In a nutshell, what statistics is all about is converting data into useful information._**  
Statistics is therefore a process in which we:-  


Collect data,  
Summarize data and  
Interpret data.  


Step One: Producing Data-  
This is the first step, which involves choosing a sample and collecting data from it. 


Step Two: Exploratory Data Analysis-
in order to explore and make sense of the data, we need to summarize it in a meaningful way. 
EDA is This second step, which consists of summarizing the collected data.


Step Three: Probability-
We need to be able to draw conclusions about the population based on the results of the sample data.
Probability is the machinery that allows us to draw conclusions about the population based on the data collected about the sample.


Step Four: The Inference-
Finally we can use what we've discovered about our sample to draw conclusions about our population. 
We call this final step in the process- The Inference.
